# We will be working on 2.3 NPM files

# Initialize 
- run ```npm init```
- This will configure our package.json file

# Installing packages
- go to npmjs.com
- We will be using a package called Sillyname for practice
- install by running the install command ```npm i sillyname``` in this case
    - Note we can install multiple packages at the same time by putting a space and then typing the name, for example:
        - ```npm i sillyname ```
- We will now see the dependency in the json file as well as the files for sillyname
- We can convert CJS (Common JavaScript) to ESM (ECMAScript Modules) by adding ```"type":"module",``` to the package.json
    - Now we can use the import keyword
