// Note: This comes after Notes.md and Using Node.js.md and we will be working with 2.2 Native Modules
// Node has a bunch of built in functions, such as file access, networking and a lot more. These are native modules.
// https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/index.html

// For now we are using the Common JS instead of EJS and working with the File System found in the doc linked above. We will be doing this in the 2.2 Native Module files
